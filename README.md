# Dunder-Mifflin-Paper-Company

This is a Flask-DBMS project about a paper company where we can make and observe changes made in the tables.

This Flask-website uses an existing mysql data. You can create a mysql database with the SQL queries given in the file `database.txt` and integrate it with flask by filling out the details of the database connection in `app.py`.
